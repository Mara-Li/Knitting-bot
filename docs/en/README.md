> You need to activate the automatic events with the `/config auto` command.

The bot will automatically add a user to a thread when:
- A user joins the server and has the permission to see the thread
- A user is updated and gets a new role
- When a channel or category that have their permission edited
- When a thread is created

The bot won't do anything when joining the server. If you want to update all threads, you can use the slash command `/update all` .

> [!NOTE] 
> The user added to the thread needs to have the permission to see it.
