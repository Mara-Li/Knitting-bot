# Update

If you want to manually update a thread, you can use the slash commands:

- `/update thread (thread)` : Update a specific thread. If the thread is not specified, it will update the current thread.
- `/update all (archived?)` : Update all threads in the server. Use the `archived` option to include archived threads.
- `/update help` : Get help about the manual slash commands

These commands don't appear for user that haven't the `manage thread` permission.

> [!WARNING]  
> It will re-add all users that leave the thread, even if they left it on purpose.
